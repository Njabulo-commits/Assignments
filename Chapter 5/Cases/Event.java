/*
    1. a. Yummy Catering provides meals for parties and special events. In Chapter 4, you created an Event class for the company.
          Now, make the following changes to the class:
        - Currently, the class contains a constant for the price per guest ($35) that is used for every guest. Replace that constant field with
          two constant fieldsâ€”a lower price per guest that is $32 and a higher price per guest that is $35.
        - Add a new method named isLargeEvent() that returns true if the number of guests is 50 or greater and otherwise returns false.
        - Modify the method that sets the number of guests so that a large Event (more than 50 guests) uses the lower price per guest to set the
          field that holds the price per guest and to calculate the total Event price. A small Event uses the higher price.
