/*
Mad Libs is a childrenâ€™s game in which the players provide a few words that are then incorporated into a silly 
story. For example, you might ask a child for the name of an animal, a number, and a direction. The child might 
reply with such answers as dog, 13, and east. The newly created Mad Lib might be:
Hickory Dickory Dock.
The dog ran up the clock.
The clock struck 13.
The dog ran east.
Hickory Dickory Dock.
Create a program that asks the user to provide a few words. Then send the words to a method that displays a 
short story or nursery rhyme that uses them. Save the file as MadLibWithMethod.java.
