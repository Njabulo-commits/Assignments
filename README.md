Repository for all projects from Cengage Java programming book

This repository contains all the Java programming projects completed from the Cengage Java programming book.

What's Included:
Each project is stored in its own directory with a descriptive name.
The code files follow consistent naming conventions for better organization.
Some projects may include additional resources like text files or images if relevant.


Learning Objectives:
By working through these projects, I gained practical experience in various Java programming concepts covered in the book, such as:

Variables, data types, and operators
Control flow statements (if, else, for, while, switch)
Methods and functions
Arrays and collections
Classes and objects
Inheritance and polymorphism
Exception handling
File handling 
GUI development 


Usage:
Clone the Repository: Use Git to clone this repository to your local machine.
Project Selection: Navigate to the directory of the specific project you want to work on.


Compiling and Running:
For most projects, you'll need a Java compiler (e.g., javac) to compile the code files (.java).
Run the compiled class file (e.g., java Main) using the java command.
Some projects might have specific instructions in their README files if they involve additional tools or configurations.


Contribution:
This repository is currently for personal reference and learning purposes. Feel free to explore the code, understand the logic, and experiment to solidify your Java skills. If you'd like to contribute your own solutions or improvements, consider creating a pull request following the guidelines of a collaborative project (if applicable).

Disclaimer:
The code provided here may not be optimized or error-proof. It's intended as a learning resource to demonstrate the concepts covered in the book. Refer to the book for detailed explanations and best practices.
