/*
a. Create a class named Lease with fields that hold an apartment tenantâ€™s name, apartment number, monthly rent amount, and term of the lease in months. 
Include a default constructor that initializes the name to XXX, the apartment number to 0, the rent to 1000, and the term to 12. Also include methods 
to get and set each of the fields. Include a non-static method named addPetFee() that adds $10 to the monthly rent value and calls a static method 
named explainPetPolicy() that explains the pet fee. Save the class as Lease.java.
